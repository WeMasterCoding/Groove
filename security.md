# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

At Superio, we take security seriously. If you discover any security issues or vulnerabilities within our project, please let us know immediately by contacting us via email at [webmastercoding@gmail.com](mailto:webmastercoding@gmail.com). We appreciate your help in disclosing the issue responsibly.

## Scope

Our security policy applies to the following components of the Superio project:

- Backend server (Django)
- Frontend application (Next.js)
- Database (PostgreSQL)
- APIs (RESTful API)

## Response Procedure

Once a security vulnerability is reported, we will acknowledge receipt of the report within 48 hours and will aim to provide a prompt initial assessment of the vulnerability. Our team will then investigate the issue and take appropriate action to address it as quickly as possible.

## Security Best Practices

To ensure the security of Superio, we recommend following these best practices:

- Keep your software dependencies up to date, including frameworks, libraries, and packages used within the project.
- Use strong and unique passwords for user accounts.
- Implement secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- Regularly review and audit user permissions and access controls.
